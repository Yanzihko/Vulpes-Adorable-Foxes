Vulpes is a race of genetically engineered servitors originated from unknown distant glitterworld. Long ago these foxes were bred at industrial scale both for glitterworld itself and interstellar trade. It's still possible to find them at some worlds. Vulpes are valued very high among slave traders because of their beauty and natural kindness. These cuties will be a nice addition either for your colony or your greedy pocket.
